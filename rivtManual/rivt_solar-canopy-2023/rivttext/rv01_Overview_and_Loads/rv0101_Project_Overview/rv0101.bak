    This structural design report for a residential solar canopy in the County
    of Marin, City of Larkspur, California includes the design of a concrete
    slab, stem wall, steel tube frame, and attachments of solar panels to the
    frame.

    The document is divided into three divisions:  

    - 01 Loads: gravity, wind, seismic 
    - 02 Frame: steel tubes, connections, clips 
    - 03 Foundation: slab, stem wall
